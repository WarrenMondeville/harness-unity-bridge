> File-based bridge enabling DeepSeek Harness to control Unity Editor operations in a running editor instance.

## Why Harness Unity Bridge?

- **Zero config** — No network setup, no port conflicts. Just install and go.
- **Deterministic CLI** — Tested Python script handles UUIDs, polling, retries, and cleanup so DeepSeek Harness doesn't have to.
- **Multi-project** — Each Unity project gets its own `.harness-unity-bridge/` directory. Work on multiple projects simultaneously.
- **Full editor control** — Run tests, compile, check logs, refresh assets, build, and control Play Mode.
- **Cross-platform** — macOS, Linux, and Windows support.

## Installation

**Install the CLI:**

```bash
pip install harness-unity-bridge
harness-unity-bridge install-skill
```

Or use the one-line installer:

```bash
# macOS / Linux / Git Bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WarrenMondeville/harness-unity-bridge/main/install.sh | bash

# Windows (PowerShell)
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WarrenMondeville/harness-unity-bridge/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

**Add the Unity package** (in Unity Editor):

`Window > Package Manager > + > Add package from git URL...`

```
https://github.com/WarrenMondeville/harness-unity-bridge.git?path=package
```

## Quick Start

Open DeepSeek Harness in your Unity project directory and ask naturally:

```
"Run the Unity tests"
"Check for compilation errors"
"Show me the error logs"
"Build for Android"
```

Or use the CLI directly:

```bash
harness-unity-bridge run-tests --mode EditMode
harness-unity-bridge compile
harness-unity-bridge get-console-logs --limit 10
harness-unity-bridge get-status
harness-unity-bridge build --target Android
```

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `run-tests` | Execute EditMode or PlayMode tests with optional filters |
| `compile` | Trigger script compilation and report errors |
| `get-console-logs` | Retrieve Unity console output (filter by Log/Warning/Error) |
| `get-status` | Check editor state — compilation, play mode, updating |
| `refresh` | Force asset database refresh |
| `play` / `pause` / `step` | Control Play Mode — enter, pause, step frames |
| `build` | Build project with direct pipeline or custom method |

## How It Works

```
DeepSeek Harness  -->  harness-unity-bridge CLI  -->  .harness-unity-bridge/command.json
                                                  |
                                            Unity Editor
                                                  |
DeepSeek Harness  <--  harness-unity-bridge CLI  <--  .harness-unity-bridge/response-{id}.json
```

1. DeepSeek Harness (or you) runs a `harness-unity-bridge` command
2. The CLI writes a JSON command with a unique UUID
3. Unity Editor polls for and executes the command
4. The CLI polls for the response with exponential backoff
5. Results are formatted and displayed; response files are cleaned up

All file I/O is atomic (temp file + rename) to prevent corruption. The CLI handles file locking, retries, and stale file cleanup automatically.

## Updating

```bash
harness-unity-bridge update
```
